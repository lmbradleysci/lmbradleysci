Currently I'm a postdoc in the [Gulf Ecosystem Initiative (GEI)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/gulfeco), which is a research partnership between the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/about) at the University of California Santa Barbara and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA) RESTORE Program](https://restoreactscienceprogram.noaa.gov/). I started in August 2025, and am currently building my independent project studying how hypoxia in the Gulf impacts shrimp populations and harvests.

I received my PhD from Emory University, advised by David Civitello, in August 2025. My dissertation was on the impacts of nutrient pollution on freshwater snail populations and schistosome parasites.
